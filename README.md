## Description

This is my portfolio, a webpage that provides information about me, a showcase of my work, my resume, and a form to contact me.

Link to GitHub pages where the portfolio is hosted: https://the64man1.github.io/React_Portfolio/

My porfolio was completed using the React framework, along with JavaScript, HTML and the Materialize framework for CSS.

Users can use modify this application with their own personal and project information for use as personal portfolio.

In completing this project, I learned how to assemble a React app from scratch. From developing architecture and structuring compenents, to iterating through data and displaying images, I've gained an understanding and appreciation for the capabilites of React.
