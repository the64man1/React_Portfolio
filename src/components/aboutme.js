            I am a full-stack web developer, with interest in back-end architecture and development, leveraging five years of experience as a practicing general dentist to best serve
            clients and users in developing interactive and engaging programs. Having graduated from the Full Stack Web Development Coding Bootcamp at Rice University, I developed the skills to use JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, React
            and other tools to develop responsive, mobile-friendly applications.

            I am passionate about precision in my
            work, solving complex problems, and working with others to build concise, highly functional code.
            I am excited to continue to expand my skill sets, obtain additional certifications, and grow as a team-player and developer. 
            In my free time I like to play golf, watch sports, play video games, and traverse the internet in search of ways to better myself as a programmer.
